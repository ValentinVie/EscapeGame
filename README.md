# Escape Game Artifact - Create a fake time bomb

## What is this? 
This is an arduino project I created from the 3D design of the box to the software running on the hardware. The goal was to create a ticking time bomb and the players had to disarm it within the given time frame.
I built the box for it to contain a 7 segment display, a keypad, 2 LED and a buzzer.

## How does it work? 
The players had to run through the following steps of actions to disarm the fake bomb:
* Find the bomb at a given location (GPS coordinates)
* Input the following code on the keypad : C65A4
* Wait for the red led to light up
* Cut the yellow cable among the other ones (red and green)
